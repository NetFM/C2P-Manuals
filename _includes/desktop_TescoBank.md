## Introduction

**Click2Park helps manage and maximise parking facilities, enabling employees to:**

- Manage Annual Permit Spaces
- Release Annual Permit Spaces for others to use whenever not required by the permit holder;
- Book HotSpaces - ad-hoc parking in a specific space within a specific time slot.

## Overview of Annual Permits & HotSpaces

**Annual Permits**

If you are offered an Annual Permit, you will have permission to park in a specific parking space within a specific Car Park for a set number of hours (usually your Working Hours) on set days of the week.

**Releasing Your Permit Space**

**Using the 'Offer My Space' feature, you can 'Release' or 'Offer' your space for others to book it whenever it is not being used** – e.g. when you may be on leave or working off-site at short notice.

**PLEASE NOTE** If you are absent from work due to illness or any other reason then please make best endeavours to either release the space yourself (which you can do 24/7 from any PC, laptop, smartphone or android device) or get someone to action this on your behalf. This could be done as part of the absence reporting procedure when notifying or updating your line manager on your absence or alternatively by contacting EHQ Reception who will ensure the space is released on your behalf (Tel 0131 203 5000 or [**email TBEHQclick2park@i.tescobank.com**](mailto:{{ page.company_email }}?subject=Click2Park%20Release%20My%20Space%20Request)..

**It is important that all colleagues have an opportunity to use car spaces when they are not being used by the parking space owner** and thus failure to release a space when not being used could result in a Yellow Card being issued. If a position is reached where a second Yellow Card is issued, you will be invited to an informal chat on how to improve the management of the parking space. Thereafter, any further oversights could then result in a Red Card being issued which in turn could lead to the withdrawal of your parking permit. If a Red card is going to be issued, you will be given two weeks’ notice of when the permit will be withdrawn, in which time you will have the opportunity to discuss the matter with the management team that look after the Click2Park system. 

All bookings made on your space when you have released it are displayed in the 'Bookings on My Space' table in the Offer My Space pages.   You will receive an email notifying you of any bookings made on your space while it is released.

**HotSpace Bookings** 

If you are not allocated an Annual Permit, you will still be able to use parking facilities by booking a 'HotSpace' on any Employee (Dark Blue) parking spaces that are available to book for your chosen Date & Times.

**A HotSpace is a car park booking for a specific space, between specific times on a specific day.**

HotSpaces can be booked in 30 minute time slots from 30 minutes to a whole day (07:00 – 19:00).

You can make a HotSpace Booking up to 10 working days in advance.

You can search for available spaces to make HotSpace Bookings in one of two ways - via either the Map View or Free Space pages:

Log In > Map View > Select Site/CarPark > Select Date/Time > Click on Available or Partially Available Space > Book HotSpace

Log In > Free Spaces > Select Site/CarPark > Select Date/Time > Click on Available or Partially Available Space > Book HotSpace

# Getting To Know Click2Park

## SpaceTypes & Booking

'SpaceTypes' are signified by different colours on the Car Park Map.

Each User Role has been given different Permissions to book certain types of Spaces.

SpaceTypes that a 'User' cannot book will show as 'Unavailable' when hovering over that space in Car Park Map View – and any spaces that your User Role does not have permission to book will not be displayed within the SiteMap Availability table or the Free Spaces page.

The following colours of spaces on Car Park Maps relate to the specific 'SpaceTypes' set within the system:

Space colour  |Space Type|Bookable by
--------------|----------|-----------
<img class="media-object pull-left" style="background:#003481" src="/img/square.png" border="0"> Dark Blue|Employee|All Users 
<img class="media-object pull-left" style="background:#00ccff" src="/img/square.png" border="0"> Light Blue|Impaired Mobility|Admin & HigherAdmin Users Only

When searching the Map for spaces that are available within the Times and Date you have selected, you may see different colours around the space's number denoting the space's availability, as defined below:

**Black**: Fully Booked / Unavailable for the Date & Times you are searching for.

**Light Green**: Partially Available for the Date & Times you are searching for.

If there is no colour surrounding the space number (e.g. you can see one of the base spacetype's colours) it should be available to book.

## Map View

**The Map View offers graphical views of Sites and Car Parks within your Click2Park system, allowing you to search for Available - and Partially Available - spaces visually** at the Car Park you have selected, on the day you have selected, within the times you have selected.

As a user, you can currently only click on the EHQ Car Park (see below) to search for and book a parking space within a detailed map view of that car park.

The spaces within the car park are colour-coded to show the type of spaces available (see above). 

Spaces that are unavailable / already booked are shown as having a black background around the space's numbering. Spaces that are Partially Free (free for part of the time you have selected) have a light or pale green background.

You can hover over any available space to view a space's number and its availability. If a space is available, you will be able to book it if you have the relevant permissions (see _2.1 Space Types_).

You can check for available spaces within a different time or date range using the drop-down date & time select fields above the car park map.

If you cannot find any remaining available spaces in a specific car park, there are none currently available to book, so please try another time or date.

If you find and click on a Partially Available space (light green), you will be shown any available times you can book the space on that day in a pop-up window and choose whether to book.

If you click on the 'Book' link, or find and click on a space that is Fully Available for the date and times you have selected, you will be taken directly to the New Reservation page to complete your booking:

You will need to confirm the booking details, such as the Booking's Date, Start & End times and can edit these if you do not need the space for the space's entire availability.

Finally, you will need to duplicate the random words within the CAPTCHA security mechanism before submitting your booking.

## Free Spaces

**The Free Spaces page displays a** **list view** **of all Free - and Partially Free - spaces** at the Car Park (or Site) you have selected, on the day you have selected, within the times you have selected.

You can search for Free Spaces to make a HotSpace Booking up to 10 working days in advance by using the drop-down date & time selectors.

You can toggle most of the columns to re-arrange the data (e.g. toggle the From column to see the first Free Spaces available within those times).

If no spaces are available, you will need to adjust the time and date filters to find an available space.

Click the 'Book' link to book a Free Space that matches your requirements.

You will be taken to the HotSpace Booking / New Reservation page (see 2.2 Map View), where you will be able to confirm the details of your HotSpace Booking, such as the Booking's Date, Start & End times.

Finally, you will need to duplicate the random words within the CAPTCHA security mechanism before submitting your booking.

## My Bookings

My Bookings shows the amount of hours you have remaining from your default Annual HotSpace Booking Hours Allocation, details of your Annual Permit (if you have been allocated one) and your HotSpace Booking History. From here, you can edit or delete a booking by simply clicking on the link in the right hand column.

When deleting a booking, a pop-up box appears asking you to confirm you want the booking deleted.

Please Note that you cannot Cancel a Booking on the same day as that Booking. If this is the case and you no longer need the space shortly before the booking starts, please contact Click2Park Support by emailing them via the Email Us link on the user menu.

## My Details

Clicking on 'My Details' will display a User's details as entered in the Click2Park database.

**Please Note: It is Your own responsibility to keep your details, such as contact information and vehicle details, updated.**

You can view and edit your account information in the following tabs within this page:

**Personal Details -** You can edit your personal details when on this screen by clicking on **Edit Personal Details**.

This will allow you to update your personal details yourself on Click2Park in the event that any of the following changes: your name, e-mail address, telephone number, main site, division or sub-divisions.

**Car Details -** You are required to enter your Vehicle Registration during Registration but, if not already entered, you will be prompted to enter it before being allowed to make a booking on Click2Park.

If you change your vehicle, you are required to amend these details in the 'Car Details' view by selecting **Edit Car Details**.

You can also add details of a second car you may use to travel to work in. Car Registrations are required for security to verify your parking permission – so you need to keep them current and up-to-date or you may receive a Yellow or Red Card and your ability to book parking spaces may be removed by HigherAdmin.

**Working Hours –** By Default, these are set from 07:00 – 19:00, Monday to Friday - but you can and should update these as relevant. Your working hours are used to define the times and days of your Permit (if you have one).

**My Permit -** Displays the details of your Annual Permit including Car Park, Space Number, Permit Type, Permit Start & End Dates & Times.

**Change Password -** Enables you to change your password at any time.

**Yellow & Red Card Details -** If you have been issued with a Yellow (or Red) Card, the details of your parking offence(s) will be displayed here. Yellow & Red Cards may be issued for a variety of reasons including Parking within the wrong space, overstaying your allocated parking period or Permit holders not Releasing Spaces,for example.

**Please Note:** Access to Click2Park or Permit ownership may be revoked if you incur excessive warnings in a calendar year. You can appeal against a Yellow or Red Card by contacting Click2Park Support via the Email Us link on the user menu.
