#Click2Park Mobile User Guide

##Introduction

**Please Note**: Before you can use the Click2Park Mobile App, you must Register with the system using the full [Desktop](../desktop/index.html) Version. 

**You cannot Register for Click2Park on the Mobile App itself**.

Click2Park Mobile simply provides the core Booking & Offer My Space functions of the Click2Park desktop version. It does not provide the desktop version's full functionality.

The Click2Park Mobile App both Permit Holders & Non-Permit Holders, allowing you to release your Permit space or book 'HotSpaces' (temporary bookings on a space) on the go…

The following User Guide explains the HotSpace Booking & Space Release processes using a smartphone, tablet or other Internet-enabled mobile device.

The Click2Park Mobile App has been designed to work on the latest mobile devices, including Apple iOS (iPhone & iPad), Android (smartphones & tablets), Windows (smartphones & tablets) & some versions of the Blackberry OS.

**Click2Park Mobile**:

- allows Users to use the 'Offer My Space' feature to Release their Space for the following week;
- allows Users to Book or Cancel HotSpaces;
- allows those with the relevant user permissions to Book Visitor spaces.

The mobile app does not allow Higher Admin users to create Permits for Users.

It also does not currently allow Reception or HigherAdmin to book for another user – only to make HotSpace Bookings for themselves.

Any bookings or space releases made via the Mobile App interface will automatically and instantly update your account within the main desktop version of Click2Park.

**If you need further help or advice using either the Mobile or Desktop versions of Click2Park, please contact the Click2Park Support Team by email using the link at top of desktop interface.

## Offer My Space / Releasing Your Space

**Using the 'Offer My Space' feature, you can 'Release' or 'Offer' your space for others to book it whenever it is not being used** – e.g. when you may be on leave or working off-site at short notice.

**PLEASE NOTE** If you are absent from work due to illness or any other reason then please make best endeavours to either release the space yourself (which you can do 24/7 from any PC, laptop, smartphone or android device) or get someone to action this on your behalf. This could be done as part of the absence reporting procedure when notifying or updating your line manager on your absence.

**It is important that all colleagues have an opportunity to use car spaces when they are not being used by the parking space owner** and thus failure to release a space when not being used could result in a Yellow Card being issued. If a position is reached where a second Yellow Card is issued, you will be invited to an informal chat on how to improve the management of the parking space. Thereafter, any further oversights could then result in a Red Card being issued which in turn could lead to the withdrawal of your parking permit. If a Red card is going to be issued, you will be given two weeks’ notice of when the permit will be withdrawn, in which time you will have the opportunity to discuss the matter with the management team that look after the Click2Park system. 

**Any bookings made on your space when you have released it are displayed in the 'Bookings on My Space' table in the Offer My Space pages of the Desktop version.** You will receive an email notifying you of any bookings made on your space while it is released. Please be aware that bookings made on your space when you have Released it can only be revoked in exceptional circumstances.
