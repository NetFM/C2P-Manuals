**Click&Park Mobile**

If you need to Release your Annual Permit space or Book a HotSpace while you are not near a PC, you can now use your internet-enabled mobile phone, smartphone or tablet to access Click&Park Mobile by typing the same address into your phone's browser address bar: [https://www.click2park.co.uk/Your-Company/](https://www.click2park.co.uk/Your-Company/)

_Please refer to the separate Click&Park Mobile User Guide for further instructions…_

## Introduction*

_ **Click&Park offers several Administrator User levels - each with different Permissions or abilities.** _

_ **This Guide explains the features available to Business Unit Representative (BUR) Administrators.** _

_For further information on basic features of the Click&Park system, please refer to the Click&Park User Guide._

## Summary of BUR Admin User Role

**A BUR Admin user is given specific Permissions over and above a normal User for all Car Parks at a specific Site.**

**You will need to use the same Log-In details as you have used previously as a User.** The Click&Park system will recognise you as a BUR when you are viewing the Site you are a designated as a BUR for.

When viewing Sites and Car Parks that you do not have BUR status for, BUR Admin users become a normal User with the same basic Permissions and abilities as a normal User.

**BUR's have the ability to Create & Amend Hotspace bookings on behalf of other Users at their designated Site and have an Unlimited Hotspace Allocation at this Site.**

BUR's can book Hotspaces on Employee, Shared, SM and Disabled spaces.

However, as with normal Users, BUR's cannot book Hotspaces on any type of Restricted space.

**BUR's can also Amend Annual Solo & Annual Shared Permits on behalf of other Users.**

They have the ability to:

- Change an Annual Solo Permit to an Annual Shared Permit and vice versa 
- Change the name of Employees who have been allocated an Annual Solo Permit, 
- Update a space's Space Type from Employee to Shared and vice versa,
- Add or Remove Sharers from an Annual Shared Permit,
- Adjust the Start & End Dates & Times of a Permit,
- Change the Space Number and/or Car Park that a Permit is for.

_ **Please Note, BUR's cannot Create an Annual Permit for a User.** _

_If this is required, please contact a Click&Park Higher Administrator who will arrange this for you._

BUR's are automatically logged out of the system within 15 minutes of inactivity or after you have been logged in for 1 hour.

**1.2 Registering with & Logging On to Click&Park**

As with normal Users, if you have not used the Click&Park system before, you will need to Register as a New User to activate your account. Your details will almost certainly already be held within Click&Park.

You will need your Employee ID, which will become your Log-In UserName.

- Go to [https://www.click2park.co.uk/RBS/](https://www.click2park.co.uk/RBS/)

- You will then need to complete the following steps to register:

**Step 1:**** Personal Information**

_Employee ID, First & Last Name, RBS eMail Address_. Click&Park will normally have been provided with your details prior to your first registration and the information you provide here is validated with internal records so that only recognised employees and known users can use the system.

**Step 2:**** Contact & Work Information**

Please provide contact information (Home Postcode, work eMail Address, primary contact Telephone Number) and define which site you mainly work / park at, your Division, Sub-Division (etc.) and your usual working hours. Please also ensure that your work email address is correct. It is the individual's responsibility to keep these details updated at all times.

**Step 3:**** Vehicle Details**

Please provide details of your main vehicle - you can also add details of a second vehicle if you use one to come to work in occasionally. These details are required to verify that cars are parked in the correct spaces booked within the system or within the correct space allocated by permits.

**Step 4:**** Security Challenge Questions**

You must provide answers to three personal questions – from a choice of several questions. These questions and the answers you provide will be used by the system as 'Challenge' questions to verify your identity when retrieving, updating or changing your password.

**Step 5:**** Set Your Password**

Finally, you will be asked to set a password. Ideally, passwords should be at least 9 characters long and contain both letters and numbers.

**Changing Passwords**

You can change your password at any time within the "My Details" page (see section _2.6 My Details_).

However, RBS Security Policy requires that passwords are changed frequently. Your Click&Park password will automatically expire and require changing every 30 days\*. The next time you access Click&Park after your password has expired, you will be prompted to change your password by generating a Password Change email that is sent to your email address and following the instructions within it.   
  
  
_ **\* Please Note** __ that you cannot use the same password as used in the previous 30 days._

**Forgotten Password?**

If you ever forget your password, click the 'Forgotten Password?' link on the Log In page.

A pop-up window\* will ask you to enter your EmployeeID and the system will then send you an email to enable you to change your password. Please follow the directions in this email.

_ **\* Please Note:** __If you are using Internet Explorer, its preferences are often set to prevent pop-up windows from opening. If this is set, when you click the Forgotten Password link you will be prompted to allow scripted windows (pop ups) from this web site in a yellow bar at the top of your browser. Click on this box and agree to 'Temporarily Allow Scripted Windows' - then click on the 'Forgotten Password?' link again._

Once registered, you can log-in to the system using your Employee ID and Password.

On logging in, you will see a Map View (see section _2.2 Map View_) of your Home Site car parks. Your Home Site is, by default, the location you specified as the site of your main place of work – or that you have been designated a BUR Admin user for. This is your Click&Park home page.

_ **You will know whether you are a BUR or a normal User at any given site by the 'Welcome' message in the top right of the Click&Park interface. This will state your User Level at that Site.** _

You can view maps of other Sites and drill down to view the individual car parks within these sites by either using the drop-down menus above the map or by directly clicking on the car parks on the map.


Also at the right hand side of the screen, you will also see a light blue dialogue box providing tips and hints for using the system - this box will be visible on every page a user visits and contains information relevant to the page you are on.

Additionally, each Site Map page shows a table displaying the availability of spaces in each car park at that site/campus for both the current day and the next. When viewing any sitemap, the availability of spaces in all car parks at that site will be displayed. The information within this table is updated automatically by the system at regular intervals throughout the day.

# BUR Interface & Menu

## BUR Menu Features & Functions

## All Bookings

## Annual Permits

## Lookup

**Below is a screenshot of the Click2Park system and the light blue navigation bar containing links to the various BUR-specific features & functions.**


**Each BUR-specific menu link and the corresponding page's functions will now be described.**

It is assumed that BUR Users are familiar with the menu link pages available to normal Users.

If you are not familiar with these, please refer to the Click&Park User Guide.

## All Bookings

**The All Bookings page displays all bookings for a particular Site or Car Park – as specified by the BUR in the drop-down menus.**

You can filter the All Bookings data by adjusting the dropdown menus for Site, Car Park, Space Type, Date and Time.

Additionally, you can enter 'free text' to search All Bookings for a specific Employee (by First Name, Last Name, Full Name or EID), a specific Space Number or Car Registration Number if known.


Once you have filtered your data as required, you can click on the 'View' link in the Actions column to View or Edit the booking. You can then Edit the Reservation.


## Annual Permits

The Annual Permits page allows BURs to search for and view:

- An Annual Permit for a specific Employee;
- All Annual Permits at a given Site or Car Park;
- An Annual Permit associated with a specific Car Registration.

The drop-down menus allow BURs to select a specific Site, a Car Park at a specific Site or a Date that a Permit is valid on.


BURs can filter results further by selecting the Site and Car Park from the drop-down selection menus, or you can search for a specific Permit by entering 'free text' into the search box.

You can search for a Permit by EmployeeID, Employee First Name / Last Name / Full Name, Car Registration or Space Number.

Once a specific Permit has been located, you have the option of saving, viewing, emailing or sending the Permit.

## Lookup

**The Lookup page allows BURs to search for specific Employees, make them Active / Inactive within the Click&Park system and Log On as that Employee.**

You can search for Employees by entering any of the following criteria into the search box:

- Employee Name
- Employee ID
- Division / Sub-Division 1 or 2
- Car Registration
- Permit Type
- Permit Status
- Car Park
- Space Number


**Once you have located the Employee(s) you are looking for, you can choose to make them Active or Inactive within the Click&Park system.**

Details of all RBS Employees should be held within the Click&Park system. Making an Employee 'Active' means that they can start to use Click&Park (once they have registered). Making an Employee 'Inactive' means that they can no longer use the system.

_ **Please Note** _ **:** Making an Employee Inactive _does not _Release the Space they have a Permit on. Their Space will stay occupied until you Delete the Reservation or Change the Permit Holder's details.

**If you need to Log On as an Employee – perhaps to release their space on their behalf, or to Edit a Reservation they have made – you can do so by clicking on their name in the left-hand column.**

Once you click on their name, you will automatically be logged in as that Employee and can use the system as if you were that Employee – but you will then only have a normal User's permissions.

To Log back in as yourself, with full BUR Permissions, you will need to first log-out as the Employee and then log-in again using your own Username & Password.

# BUR HotSpace Functions

**3.1 Bookable Space Types**

When searching the system for free spaces, the following will indicate availability of a space:




**Additionally, you are able to Book a HotSpace on the following Space Types:**

## Creating a HotSpace for an Employee

**In order to Create a HotSpace for yourself or an Employee, you first need to find a Space that is Free for the Date & Times you require. BURs can search for free Spaces up to 6 days in advance.**

You can do this by either viewing the Map View page and visually identifying any Spaces that are fully Free or Partially Free for the Date & Times you have selected, or by searching on the Free Spaces page.

**Using Map View:**

Once you have selected a Site, you can click on a Site Map or use the drop-down menus to navigate to a specific Car Park – and then toggle the Date, Start Time & End Time menus to select the correct period required for the Booking.


Once you have located and clicked on a Space that is Free, a Pop-up window will appear which gives information of any current bookings on that Space and any times that the Space is available on the chosen Date. You can then click the 'Book' link to open the 'New Reservation' page, as shown on the next page.

**Free Spaces Page:**

Once you have selected a Site, you can use the drop-down menus to view any Free or Partially Free spaces within a specific Car Park.

By default, the Date is set to Today's date and the Time is set to the most recent half hour. You can toggle the Date & Time drop-down menus to search for spaces up to 6 days in advance.


Once you have located and clicked on a Space that is Free for the Date & Time required, click on the 'Book' link in the Action column. This will open the New Reservation page, as shown below.


By default, the Date and Times will be set to the Date & Times you searched with.

When booking a HotSpace for an Employee other than yourself, you will need to verify the Employee's exact identity by entering their name and clicking on the blue 'Lookup' link next to it.

This will open up a pop-up window with a list of similarly named employees and their Employee IDs.

Select the correct Employee by clicking on their name and the window will close automatically after a couple of seconds. You can then Submit the Reservation.

Please Note: Even if you know the Employee ID, you will need to click on the blue Lookup link to verify the Employee's identity.

## Creating a HotSpace for a Visitor

**As with booking a HotSpace for an Employee, in order to Create a HotSpace for yourself or an Employee, you first need to find a Space that is Free for the Date & Times you require using either the Map View page or by searching on the Free Spaces page.**

Once you have located and clicked on a Space that is Free (Map View), or clicked on the 'Book' link (Free Spaces page), the New Reservation page will open, as shown below.


Click the round button next to the word 'Visitor" and Enter the Visitor's Name, Car Registration, Telephone & Email Address in the relevant boxes.

The Visitor's Name, Car Registration & Telephone details are required information. If you do not know these details, the system will request that you enter the word 'UNKNOWN' into these fields before you can Submit the Reservation.

You will then see the Confirmation page that provides a summary of your HotSpace Reservation.

Below these details are buttons to Email, View (Print or Save), Edit or Delete your reservation.

Clicking the Email button will open a new Pop-up window where you can enter the Visitor or Employee's email address. Clicking the Submit button will send them the permit by email.


## Amending a HotSpace for an Employee

**To Amend an existing HotSpace booking on behalf of an Employee, find the reservation using either the Map View or the All Bookings pages, as previously described.**

Once in the correct Car Park in Map View, you can toggle the Date & Time dropdown menus to the approximate times of the HotSpace booking you are looking for and then click on the Space you are looking for. This will either open a new page showing a single reservation if there is only one reservation on that space within the times you have selected.

If there is more than one booking on the space within the times you have selected, a pop-up window displaying details of these bookings will open and you can select the HotSpace booking you need to amend.

**If you do not know the space number** that the Hotspace booking has been made on, then it is best to use the All Bookings page. Select the correct Site and Car Park (if known) and either browse the bookings or type in the Employee's Name, EmployeeID or Car Registration.

Once you have located the correct HotSpace booking, you will first see the Reservations Details page and, having clicked on the Edit button, you can edit it within the Edit Reservation page, as shown below.

**If you need to Delete the HotSpace booking,** there is a Delete button on the Reservation Details page.


**If you need to change the Site, Car Park or Space Number,** you can do so using the relevant dropdown menus. Click&Park will automatically provide the first space available within the times you have selected.

**If you need to change the Date and Start or End Times,** you can also do so using the relevant dropdown menus. However, if the space is not available within new Date or Times you have selected, please be aware that Click&Park may automatically change the Space number to another in the same Car Park that is available for these times. If there is no other space available in that Car Park for those times, you will receive a red warning message.

**If you need to change the Employee** that the booking is for, you need to enter their name in the Employee Name field and click on the blue 'Lookup' link to verify their identity, as when creating a booking. After you have submitted the reservation, you have the option to Email it to the Employee or View (Print / Save it.)

**3.5 Amending a HotSpace for a Visitor**

To Amend an existing HotSpace booking for a Visitor, find the reservation using either the Map View or the All Bookings pages, as previously described.

Once in the correct Car Park in Map View, you can toggle the Date & Time dropdown menus to the approximate times of the HotSpace booking you are looking for and then click on the Space you are looking for. This will either open a new page showing a single reservation if there is only one reservation on that space within the times you have selected.

If, however, there are more than one (or overlapping) bookings on that space within the times you have selected, a pop-up window displaying details of these bookings will open and you can select the HotSpace booking you need to amend.

If you do not know the space number that the Hotspace booking has been made on, then it is best to use the All Bookings page. Select the correct Site and Car Park (if known) and either browse the bookings or type in the Visitor's Name or Car Registration.

Once you have located the correct HotSpace booking, you will first see the Reservations Details page and, having clicked on the Edit button, you can edit it within the Edit Reservation page, as shown below.

If you need to Delete the HotSpace booking, there is a Delete button on the Reservation Details page.


**If you need to change the Site, Car Park or Space Number,** you can do so using the relevant dropdown menus. Click&Park will automatically provide the first space available within the times you have selected.

**If you need to change the Date and Start or End Times,** you can also do so using the relevant dropdown menus. However, if the space is not available within new Date or Times you have selected, please be aware that Click&Park may automatically change the Space number to another in the same Car Park that is available for these times. If there is no other space available in that Car Park for those times, you will receive a red warning message.

**If you need to change or update the Visitor's details,** you can do this in the relevant text boxes. After you have submitted the reservation, you have the option to Email it to the Employee or View and then Print or Save it.

**4. BUR Annual Permit Functions**

4.1 Changing an Annual Solo to an Annual Shared Permit

4.2 Changing the name of an Employee on an Annual Solo Permit

4.3 Add or Remove Sharers from an Annual Shared Permit

4.4 Update a Space Type from Employee to Shared

4.5 Adjust the Start & End Dates & Times of a Permit

4.6 Change the Reservation's Space Number and/or Car Park

## Changing an Annual Solo to an Annual Shared

**Once you have located the correct Annual Permit reservation from either the Map View, All Bookings or Annual Permits page, you will see the Reservation Details page. Click on Edit.**

**Please Remember,** when updating a Solo Permit to a Shared Permit – or vice versa - you must also change the _Space Type_ to Employee (for a Solo Permit) or Shared (for a Shared Permit). Please see section 4.4 if you are unsure how to do this.

To change an Annual Solo to a Shared Permit – or vice versa - you simply need to change the Reservation Type to the required type.

**If you are changing a Permit from a Solo to a Shared** , the previous Solo Permit holder's details will be displayed as the first sharer by default.

Their name can be removed if they are not a Sharer on the new Shared Permit.

For each Sharer you add to the Permit, you need to verify their identity by clicking the 'Lookup' link next to their name, and then select the correct Employee from within the pop-up window that will open.

**If you are changing the Permit from a Shared to a Solo** , the first sharer's details will remain displayed as the new Solo Permit holder by default.

Their name can be removed if the Permit is no longer for them.

If you change the permit holder's name, you will again need to verify their identity by clicking the 'Lookup' link next to their name, and then select their name as the correct Employee from within the pop-up window that will open.

Once you have finished, click the Submit button to confirm the amended reservation.


## Changing an Employee Name on an Annual Solo

**Once you have located the correct Annual Permit reservation using either the Map View, All Bookings or Annual Permits page, you will see the Reservation Details page. Click on Edit.**


**To change the Employee's name** , enter the new details in the 'For Employee' text field (highlighted above) and click on the blue 'Lookup' link to the right hand side – this is required so that both yourself and Click&Park can verify the correct identity of the Employee the permit is for.

A Pop-up window will open displaying the Name and Employee ID of any users with similar or the same name.

Select the correct Employee by clicking on their name and the window will close automatically after a couple of seconds.

The new permit holders Name and Employee ID will then be automatically displayed in the text box on the Edit Reservations page.


Click Submit to confirm the amended reservation.

You will then see the Reservation Details page showing a summary of the new Permit Reservation and have the option to Email it to the permit holder or yourself, Edit the Reservation again (if the details are not correct for some reason), View the permit as a PDF (and either Print it out or Save it), Delete the reservation or Continue to the page you were on before selecting the Permit to Edit.

**4.3 Add or Remove Sharers from a Shared Permit**

**A maximum of 5 Sharers can be allocated to an Annual Shared Permit.**

Once you have located the correct Annual Permit reservation using the Map View, All Bookings or Annual Permits page, you will see the Reservation Details page. Click on Edit.


In the examples pictured above and below, there are 3 existing sharers and a new fourth sharer to be added to the permit. Enter the Employee's Name (or part of their name) into the next available text field and click the blue 'Lookup' link on the right hand side.

For each Sharer you add to the Permit, you need to verify their identity by clicking the 'Lookup' link next to their name, and then select the correct Employee by clicking on their name within the pop-up window that will open. The window will close automatically and the Employee's details will appear in the text field.


When all sharers have been added to the Permit, click the submit button to confirm the reservation.

## Update a Space Type from Employee to Shared

**When creating or editing an Annual Solo or Annual Shared Permit, you must also change the Space Type to reflect the Reservation Type.**

**- Employee Space Types are displayed as Pink spaces on the Map View page.**

**- Shared Space Types are displayed as Yellow spaces on the Map View page.**

Within the Create Reservation or Edit Reservation pages, you will see a dropdown menu on the right hand side containing the options of 'Employee' or 'Shared', as displayed below.

**- Annual Solo Permits should be given the Space Type of 'Employee'.**

**- Annual Shared Permits should be given the Space Type of 'Shared'.**


Amend the Space Type dropdown menu to the correct option and click the blue 'Update Space Type' text link to make the change.

The page will refresh after a couple of seconds and display your chosen option.

Either continue to make your amendments to the Reservation, or click the Submit button to confirm your amendments.

**4.5 Adjust Start or End Time of a Permit**

**BURs can adjust the Start & End Times of a Permit using the dropdown Time menus and the Start & End Dates using the Click&Park calendar function.**


**To change the Start & End Times of a Permit,** use the Time dropdown menu to change either the Start and/or End Time.

You cannot set the Start Time before the End Time and will receive an error message if you try to.

The Start and End Times of a Permit will default to the working hours that have been entered into the system for the Employee that an Annual Solo Permit is for.

They will also default to the working hours entered for the Lead Sharer (or First Sharer) for an Annual Shared Permit.

**To change the Start & End Dates of a Permit,** click on the Calendar symbol next to the Date to use the Click&Park calendar function.

By default, the End Time and Date of all Permits are set to 19:00 on 31st December of the current year. However, you can set a Permit to expire before this date, if required.

**The Calendar allows you to choose any day, month, and year for the Permit to start or end on.**

You can choose Today's date by clicking on the word 'Today', but you must also then click on the actual Day that is highlighted in blue (the 14th in the example to the left) for the change to take effect and update the Permit Start or End Date.

You can change the Day by clicking on the required date, the Month by clicking on the single arrow and the Year by clicking on the double arrow.

**Please Note** , you must click on the actual day you require for any change to take effect and update the Reservation.

Once you have completed adjusting the Start or End Times and Dates, click Submit to confirm your changes.



**4.6 Change Reservation's Car Park & Space Number**

**BURs can adjust the Car Park and/or Space Number that a Permit is allocated to using the dropdown menus for Car Park or Space Number.**


**When Changing the Car Park** that a Reservation is for, the Space Number will automatically update to the first available space that is available within the selected Car Park for the dates and times you have selected.

**If no Space is available** within the selected Car Park, a message will appear where the space number should be informing you that there are _"No spaces available, please select another date or time"_. Either select another date or time combination, or select a different Car Park to see what may be available there.

**If there is a Space available** for the dates and times you have selected within the next Car Park you have selected, you can use the Space Number dropdown menu to see which other spaces are available at that Car Park for those dates and times and choose your preferred space.

When you have successfully adjusted the Car Park and / or Space Number, click the Submit button to confirm your changes and save the adjusted Reservation.
