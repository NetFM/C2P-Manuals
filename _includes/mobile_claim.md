##Introduction

The Click2Park Mobile App allows users to book 'HotSpaces' (temporary bookings on a space), Claim their Space for the following week & release their Permit space on the go…

The following User Guide explains the HotSpace Booking & Claim My Space processes using a smartphone, tablet or other Internet-enabled mobile device.

The Click2Park Mobile App has been designed to work on the latest mobile devices, including Apple iOS (iPhone & iPad), Android (smartphones & tablets), Windows (smartphones & tablets) & some versions of the Blackberry OS.

**General System Information**
##General System Information

Click2Park Mobile simply provides the core Booking & Claim My Space functions of the Click2Park desktop version.

It does not provide the desktop version's full functionality.

**Click2Park Mobile** :

- allows Employee Users to use the 'Claim My Space' feature to claim their Space for the following week;
- allows Employee Users to Book or Cancel HotSpaces;
- allows those with the relevant user permissions to Book Visitor spaces.

The mobile app does not allow Higher Admin users to create Permits for Users.

It also does not currently allow Reception or HigherAdmin to book for another user – only to make HotSpace Bookings for themselves.

Any bookings or space releases made via the Mobile App interface will automatically and instantly update your account within the main desktop version of Click2Park.

**If you need further help or advice using either the Mobile or Desktop versions of Click2Park, please contact the Click2Park Support Team by email using the link at top of desktop interface.
