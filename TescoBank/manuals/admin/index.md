# Admin User Guide

## Different admin roles

Most operations within Click2Park are performed by end users managing their own parking requirements. Beyond end users Click2Park offers administaror roles that can have taylored levels of additional privileges. By default the system provides the following three administrator roles:-

1. [Administrator](administrator.md)

2. [Business administrator](business.md)

3. [Higher administrator](higher.md)

Individual users can be assigned these roles on a site by site basis by higher administrators. Higher administrators can also request new roles to be bcreated to reflect particular permisssions required for car park management within their organisation.
